# lightfm-movie-recommendation-system
LightFM is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback.

It also makes it possible to incorporate both item and user metadata into the traditional matrix factorization algorithms. It represents each user and item as the sum of the latent representations of their features, thus allowing recommendations to generalise to new items (via item features) and to new users (via user features).

The code contains both the warp as well as the bpr model.
